Usages of the minimum spanning tree algorithms:

* "They were first studied for ways to lay out electrical networks in a 
way that minimizes the total cost of the wiring. In a minimum spanning tree,
   all the nodes would be connected to power wired in a way that has minimum cost and 
   redundancy (cutting any wire necessarily cuts the power grid into two pieces)".
  (from [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7320465/applications-of-kruskal-and-prims-algorithms))
  
* They are part of the Chirstofides algorithm for finding approximate solutions for the Traveling Salesman Problem.

* Both Kruskal's and Prim's algorithms can be used to generate mazes, so they are part of computer games.

* In a large LAN (Local Area Network) with many switches, finding the minimum spanning tree ensures that only the 
minimum number of packets will be transmitted.
  
* Prim's and Kruskal's algorithm are also important for finding public transit routes and landing cables. In fact, we
found [this article](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/291907607_On_the_application_of_prim's_algorithm_to_a_profit-oriented_transportation_system_in_rural_areas_of_nigeria)
   that applies Prim's alogirhtm to build road networks in rural areas of Nigeria.
